# Accelerating CFD solvers

In this test case, we try to check the feasibility of RL to dynamically update underrelaxation factors in CFD solvers to accelerate the convergence in CFD simulations of turbulent flows. We test our framework for the backward facing step examples where an agent is trained for different inlet velocities.
