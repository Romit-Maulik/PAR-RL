# RLLib_Theta
Scaling RLLib for generic simulation environments on Theta. Built on [setup](https://github.com/ytopt-team/tuster) initiated by Romain Egele for YTOPT.

## Dependencies
1. Tensorflow 1.14.0
2. Gym 0.17.1
3. Ray 0.7.6
4. Numpy 1.16.1

### To do - funnel system calls to OpenFoam through subprocess within gym custom environment
### To do - call tensorflow surrogate models through static graph execution within gym custom environment
### To do - assess scaling of both on Theta (OpenFoam5, intel compiler)
